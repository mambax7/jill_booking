=================

You will need to have installed TADTOOLS module:

Other that that, no other special measures necessary. Just follow the standard installation process and extract the module folder into the ../modules directory.

Install the module through Admin -> System Module -> Modules.

Detailed instructions on installing modules are available in the XOOPS Operations Manual: http://goo.gl/adT2i
